## Overview
### Description
The app is developed based on the need of visualization and images for menus of different kinds of restaurants. Users are able to scan the menu and click on the food titles of their choice to preview its image to be shown on the screen, which makes it easier for them to order.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Food service/Restaurant
- **Mobile:** This app is primarily intended to be in a mobile application since it will utilize the feature of a phone's camera and it will be a daily convenient for people since they carry their phone most of the time. The app can also be viable on a dedicated app in the computer or a web app by browsing previously saved menus done through the phone app.
- **Story:** User can snap a picture of a menu taken into their phone's camera, and can visually see the titles of the food as well as its corresponding images. 
- **Market:** The target audience of this app is the general public wherein anyone can use this user-friendly app and take a snap of the menu. The app also targets the food services businesses as they can also use it effectively to promote their food business.
- **Habit:** This app can be used most often when users go to restaurants whose menus lack visual representations of their food titles. This app can also be viewed anytime if the user saved the informaton in the app to view previous snap.
- **Scope:** The project's goal is to effectively take a picture of the menu and recognize the texts in the image as well as the translate the texts into images that can be viewed by users of the app. We can then move on to have an effectively machine learning capability where it can detect different languages. Additionally, user can store their previous snap and use that as a reference. Eventually, if we have enough time, users will have the capability to map out their saved menus to places they are geographically located at so that other users can view them.
